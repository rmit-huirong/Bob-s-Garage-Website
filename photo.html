<font face="Arial"><b>I know you would like to see what your item looks like in the process of being restored.  Taking those pictures is harder than you may think.  A phone picture wouldn't show you anything as the quality of the photo is so poor, and for some reason, half the time they don't show up where you send them ...so here's what has to happen:  Someone has to go into the shop or warehouse and find your restoration among many, many others.  Then we have to move it which involves moving a lot of other restorations.  Then we have to put it in a place to photograph it.  After that we would transfer the photo into a photo file in the computer.  Then we would have to send you an email and find that picture in a vast photo file and attach it to that email to be sent to you.  Then we send it to you.<br>

I don't know about you, but it's going to take me a while to get this done and I already work all day every day.  But we would be happy to do it for you.  Photos are $20 each..</b></font>
