<font face="Arial,Helvetica">I guess it's human nature to want the things you want when you want them.  Unfortunately sometimes we find ourselves in a situation where it's just not possible.  Like when you order a custom vintage restored gas pump or soda machine from Bob's Garage. </font>
<br>
<br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">These antiques are really scarce.  And old.  And very labor intensive to restore properly.  A proper restoration includes more than just a "paint job".  It involves disassembly, cleaning, media blasting, sheet metal preparation, paint, new trim, rubber seals, etc.  This takes time.  How many pieces we have in our shop to restore at any particular time, dictates how long your piece will take.  Remember to order early if you're on a deadline. Our usual build time is 120 days or longer depending upon how busy we are.</font>
<br>
<br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">What you get when your piece is delivered will be a one of a kind antique that will appreciate in value year after year and will be the focal point of any room or collection.  That kind of quality can't be turned out in a couple of days. So if you can't wait for us to do the normal high quality job we do when we restore antique pieces.....then please don't order from us.  We have thousands of happy return customers who know that work of this type takes time and are happy to wait until we are finished to receive their pieces. Remember, good things are worth waiting for.</font>
<br>
<br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Items left at Bob's Garage, either paid or unpaid, after 30 days become the property of Bob's Garage. Storage fee  $10 per day ... no exceptions.</font>
