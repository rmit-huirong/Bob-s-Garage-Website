<font face="Arial,Helvetica">I really am happy for the quality of work on my Vendo 39.  Thank you for helping to bring a piece of Americana back to life.  I love it.</font><br><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The rebuild took a long time.  Communication is sometimes a bit slow and sketchy.  I’ve never spoken or met Bob actually in person - - is he real?   But damn you guys do really really fine work and I appreciate the special talent. Would definitely want to work with you again.</font><br><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would still like to come up and see you guys some day when the filming is over - -would like to check out Bob’s truck and look at the stuff in your shop.  I will follow up with you on that.</font><br><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">My wife and her sister had a chance to view their dad's old, now restored, Coke machine this afternoon and were very much impressed with the great job done getting it back in original shape.</font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">I know it was a long haul in getting it done, but it was worth the cost and the time.</font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thanks again Bob.</font><br><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Best regards,</font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hi,</font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">There wasn't enough room room in the feedback section to be able to tell you how much I love, love, love this trashcan!</font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is amazing. We are having our annual 4th of July Bar-B-Que and I can't wait for everyone to see it. There are a lot of man cavers coming and I know they are going to want something like this. Maybe not coke, but I am sure there are going to be a lot of guys ordering from you! </font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thank you so very much and I will certainly pass your ebay name to everyone that wants it!</font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hello Bob,</font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">I ordered one of the Coca Cola Jr. refrigerated soda machines from you last Monday, and it arrived first thing this Tuesday morning.  I couldn't be happier with the machine, and its appearance and operation.  While I would love to have one of the original Westinghouse models my budget would not allow for it, but the attention to detail on this reproduction is so good that I doubt the average person could even tell the difference.  Thank you very much for all your help!</font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Kindest Regards,</font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Bob,</font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">We received the sinclair pump today. It arrived in perfect condition! That was quite a crating job! Your work is truly first class, and I am very impressed! I have a wonderful wife, who found me such a cool guy gift. I sometimes worry that she will be "taken" when shopping for me. It is nice to know that there are still some honest business men who can be trusted! Thanks again for your efforts. We will provide your classic work of art with nice home among some nice classic cars.</font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Bob,</font><br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">I got my Rat Fink jacket the other day and it's great! It fits real good and looks totally awesome. Thanks for your help, and I'll be checking your site for other items that I might like. It's been a pleasure dealing with you. If you have a feedback page, I'd be glad to add a comment.<br><br>
