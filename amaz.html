<img src="amaz.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="WE'RE NOT AMAZON" align="left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Today, everybody wants what they want-- RIGHT NOW (including me).  Most    people think that if you place an order online or by phone, it    automatically ships the same day, or maybe the next day. For mass-produced goods from abroad, that may work. It's impossible for us to work    that way.</font>
<br>
<br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some things can ship in a day or two,  many in 7 - 10 days. But most of    our work is custom work that has to be built by hand. Often a spare part    will be hard to find or must be reproduced. And we have LOTS of builds    on the books</font>
<br>
<br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The shipping department works every day Monday through Friday shipping    domestic as well as international. Please know that we are working very    hard to get your order to you. But we don't have any drones that    deliver ... not yet anyway.</font>
<br>
<br>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">And thanks for being our customer.  We always appreciate your  business  </font>
